# tests/fm-spawn-browser-isolation.test.sh - spawn-path regressions proving every
# firstmate-launched agent receives the browser-isolation environment, using fake
# tmux panes and real isolated git worktrees.
#
# AGENTS.md section 3 points every agent at chrome-devtools-axi and crewmates run
# with permissions bypassed, so the browser that tool reaches is inside the
# agent's blast radius. chrome-devtools-axi's own default is already an isolated
# throwaway profile, but a default is not a guarantee: any CHROME_DEVTOOLS_AXI_*
# value exported into firstmate's environment is inherited by every agent it
# launches, and the unnamed "default" session is one shared bridge. fm-spawn
# therefore pins the isolating choice on the launch command itself.
#
# These tests pin the assembled launch command, which is the interface firstmate
# actually ships to a pane, and the capability gate that decides whether the
# per-task-bridge half of that pin can be honoured at all. The companion guard
# tests/fm-browser-isolation-live-e2e.test.sh proves the two facts a launch string
# cannot show: that the pinned values really select an isolated profile in the
# installed chrome-devtools-axi, and that they survive into the shell a real
# harness gives its agent.
